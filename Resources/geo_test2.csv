8,31113,US,"Restrained aromatically, this bottling shows touches of crushed lava rocks, black pepper and blackberry on the nose. Balsamic vinegar and sour cherry flavors mark the sip, with very sticky tannins.",Grosso,85,45.0,California,San Benito County,Central Coast,Bella Luna 2012 Grosso Sangiovese (San Benito County),Sangiovese,Bella Luna,Santa Margarita,35.430831,-120.467263
16,50892,US,"A light, bright, affordable quaffer, this youthful wine is flinty with a juicy core of fresh-pressed grapefruit and lemon peel. It retains varietal character and a buoyancy throughout, finishing with grace and persistence.",Rosé of,90,22.0,California,Sonoma Coast,Sonoma,Brick & Mortar 2015 Rosé of Pinot Noir (Sonoma Coast),Pinot Noir,Brick & Mortar,Santa Margarita,35.30025,-119.907174
18,10417,US,"Very strong white peach and lemon blossom aromas meet with roasted chicken, honeysuckle and chamomile on the nose of this bottling. Apple, pear and nectarine show on the palate, as does fresh cherimoya, graphite and more white peach toward the finish.",Diamond T Vineyard,91,52.0,California,Monterey,Central Coast,Talbott 2013 Diamond T Vineyard Chardonnay (Monterey),Chardonnay,Talbott,Templeton,35.557468,-120.750236
20,58692,US,"This Syrah-Zin blend is forward in jammy raspberry, cherry, herb tea and spice flavors. It's simple, but crisp acidity gives it a firm, clean finish.",Le Pique-Nique,84,14.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Wellington 2007 Le Pique-Nique Rosé (Sonoma Valley),Rosé,Wellington,Templeton,35.557468,-120.750236
25,92481,US,"Each of Channing Daughter's eight 2011 vintage rosato express a distinct personality, but the Mudd Vineyard Merlot stands out with its seamless integration of ripe, supple fruit with intense minerality and a dewy, floral flair that's irresistible, sip after sip. This is bone dry and begs to be opened as soon as possible.",Rosato Merlot Mudd Vineyard,90,18.0,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Long Island,Channing Daughters 2011 Rosato Merlot Mudd Vineyard Rosé (North Fork of Long Island),Rosé,Channing Daughters,New York,40.714269,-74.005973
31,8438,US,"There's lots of mouthwatering acidity in this bone-dry Pinot Noir, with an ample supply of ripe fruit in the form of raspberries and cherries. There's also something wonderfully earthy, like roasted mushrooms splashed with balsamic and tamari sauce. The cool 2010 vintage was kind to Bacigalupi Vineyard, which can produce overripe wines in hot years.",Bacigalupi Vineyard,92,39.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Von Holt 2010 Bacigalupi Vineyard Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,Von Holt,Santa Margarita,35.303692,-120.376285
34,125307,US,"This wine shows its warm, sunny Napa origins through its incredible concentration of fruit. Don't look for subtlety here. It's the power of blackberries, currants and chocolate that impresses, as well as the penetrating quality of the tannins. Will age beautifully over the next 12–15 years, but it's so good now, you might be tempted to pop the cork.",Stagecoach Vineyard,94,100.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,PerryMoore 2008 Stagecoach Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,PerryMoore,Templeton,35.557468,-120.750236
43,102879,US,"Minerality takes center stage on the nose from Roblar's top-end line of wines, with limestone and wet slate getting boost from fresh squeezed lemon. On the palate, the crushed rock flavors continue with some pear as well, making for a mellow sipping experience. Serve with shellfish, white fish or a soft cheese.",Gold Collection,89,50.0,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Central Coast,Roblar 2012 Gold Collection Chardonnay (Sta. Rita Hills),Chardonnay,Roblar,Santa Ynez,34.65419,-120.114857
50,80058,US,"There's a delicacy to this Pinot that makes it a welcome alternative to the big, clumsy style. The color is translucent, and the alcohol is relatively low, giving it a nice, bouncy mouthfeel. The depth of flavor is impressive, suggesting ripe forest raspberries and cherries, and a hint of mushrooms. It would be a pity to drink this wine before 2017.",Jensen Vineyard,93,75.0,California,Mt. Harlan,Central Coast,Calera 2010 Jensen Vineyard Pinot Noir (Mt. Harlan),Pinot Noir,Calera,California City,35.132816,-117.937028

57,35902,US,"Fermented in 80% stainless steel and 20% barrel, this at first shows a touch of barrel reduction on the nose that dissipates into richly layered stone fruit and fresh lime.

58,79074,US,"From some of the property's oldest vines, this wine conveys a nostalgic component that's hard to resist, an approachability that meets length and breadth. Baked bread, cherry, vanilla and black tea give way to zesty acidity and a note of forest floor, but nothing competes with the allure of rose petals and orange blossoms that beckon around every corner.",Three Corner,94,86.0,California,Russian River Valley,Sonoma,Rochioli 2014 Three Corner Pinot Noir (Russian River Valley),Pinot Noir,Rochioli,Templeton,35.557468,-120.750236
62,7171,US,"Some wineries releasing a new Garys' Syrah would charge a lot more, but Novy keeps their prices moderate. While this wine is enormously tannic and dry, it shows a complex range of blackberry and stone fruit, tobacco, currant, charred meat bone, black pepper and mineral flavors, with the oak influence evident but subtle. Given the extreme dryness and tannins, as well as significant alcohol, the question is will the wine age. It doesn't seem likely to, so decant and drink up through 2020.",Garys' Vineyard,90,32.0,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Central Coast,Novy 2011 Garys' Vineyard Syrah (Santa Lucia Highlands),Syrah,Novy,Santa Margarita,35.379204,-120.659759
67,122040,US,"So soft and dense in richness, this is easy to enjoy now. But you really want to restrain that impulse and give it some time in the cellar. Blended from roughly equal parts of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot, it's dry and tannic, but with a molten core of blackberries, cherries, blueberries, anise and sweet new oak. Very fine, very elaborate and complex. Give it 5–6 years, at least. This wine could still be unfolding in 2020.",Contrarian,94,125.0,California,Napa Valley,Napa,Blackbird Vineyards 2010 Contrarian Red (Napa Valley),Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Blackbird Vineyards,Santa Margarita,35.322061,-119.898254
69,65417,US,"Rich and ripe on the nose with dark black fruit and olives, this is an easygoing blend of Syrah, Cab and Merlot.

70,1277,US,"There's a minty, ammonia streak of greenness that can charitably be described as gooseberry in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Oak brings sweet vanilla richness, but the wine is still pretty eccentric.",Estate Grown,84,24.0,California,Sonoma Valley,Sonoma,Petroni 2010 Estate Grown Sauvignon Blanc (Sonoma Valley),Sauvignon Blanc,Petroni,Templeton,35.557468,-120.750236
73,56025,US,"Hints of earth and spice accent savory apple aromas on this slightly off-dry Riesling.

87,103540,US,"This top-shelf red blend from television producers Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick shows cooked blackberry, purple flower, soy and anise aromas on the nose. Oregano and marjoram lead the palate, which is moderately dense, with tangy blackberry and boysenberry flavors.",Romantique Reserve,91,60.0,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Villa San Juliette 2013 Romantique Reserve Red (Paso Robles),Red Blend,Villa San Juliette,Templeton,35.557468,-120.750236
90,91780,US,"This wine from the heart of the appellation is woody with cedar and sage notes, its leathery texture defined by firm tannins. Full-bodied, it shows an underlying streak of bright acidity, keeping it balanced and lively in the glass, highlighted with black cherry and currant fruit.",Rockaway Vineyard,91,75.0,California,Alexander Valley,Sonoma,Rodney Strong 2013 Rockaway Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon (Alexander Valley),Cabernet Sauvignon,Rodney Strong,Templeton,35.557468,-120.750236
92,46913,US,"Very dark and dramatic, this delicious wine combines great balance with power. It has exotic fruit flavors and a light spiciness. The smooth, sculpted mouthfeel comes with rich, almost thick tannins that seem to extend the finish. This will find its full potential sometime after 2020.",Reposado,93,25.0,California,Amador County,Sierra Foothills,Borjón 2014 Reposado Petite Sirah (Amador County),Petite Sirah,Borjón,Llano,34.527808,-117.812015
